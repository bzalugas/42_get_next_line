* GET_NEXT_LINE
This 42 project aims to code a get_next_line function to our collection. The main concept to learn is *static variables*.
* PROTOTYPE
#+begin_src C
char    *get_next_line(int fd);
#+end_src
The =fd= parameter beeing the file descriptor to read.

Repeated calls to the function should let us read the text file pointed to by =fd=, one line at a time.

The function returns the line that was read, *including the \n*, except if the end of the file was reached and dos not end with \n character. If there is nothing else to read or if an error occured, it should return =NULL=.

Since we need a buffer size to read the file, this option will be added to the compiler call: =-D BUFFER_SIZE=n=. The project should compile with and without the option.
